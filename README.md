# ELECSY Electronic-shop

This project helps us to create an online platform that offers a
seamless shopping experience, informative product descriptions, and a
user-friendly interface.
Here we are mainly using pandas numpy and warning libraries which are already present in python
to create a back end interface which when paired with a proper front end can make an android app or a full fledged website 
The main aim of the project is to reduce the efforts put in by workers by engaging the machines and computers to do the work in store 
with minimal supervision from the workers or staffs.Manual claculations,long period of works and power consumption and cost can be 
reduced by the ELECSY electronic shop
